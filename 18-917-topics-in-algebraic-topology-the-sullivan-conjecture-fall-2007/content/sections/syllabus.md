Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

Let _G_ be a finite _p_\-group acting on a nice topological space _X_. The Sullivan conjecture asserts that the _p_\-adic homotopy type of the fixed point set can be recovered from the action of G on the _p_\-adic completion of the homotopy type of _X_. The goal of this course is to describe some of the tools (the theory of unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra) which enter into the proof of Sullivan's conjecture.

Prerequisites
-------------

Algebraic Topology II, (18.906). A working knowledge of modern algebraic topology will be assumed, but all of the calculational machinery (such as the Steenrod algebra) will be constructed from scratch.

Text
----

We will loosely follow the book:

Schwartz, Lionel. _Unstable Modules over the Steenrod Algebra and Sullivan's Fixed Point Set Conjecture_. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1994. ISBN: 9780226742021.
